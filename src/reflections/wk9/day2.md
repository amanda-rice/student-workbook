# Github Actions and How to Use Them
## What is a Github action and how do they work?
Github actions are rules (workflows) that you declare in your repository with YAML files that handle common tasks such as testing your code or compressing images. Tasks can also run based on a specific interaction or on a time frame. For example, you can be sent a message when someone makes a comment.

## What benefits do Github actions provide?
They save time by running actions automatically. You can also set up notifications for events such as someone stars a repo.
