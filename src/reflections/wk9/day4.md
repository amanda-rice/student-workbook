Secure Sockets Layer certificate. SSL's are data files that create an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. Makes sure data passed between them is private.
## What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
Extended Validation SSL Certificate: Most expensive. Displays HTTPS, business name, padlock, and business country in the address bar. This helps build credibility. Important if you process web payments

Organizational Validated Certificate: Medium level encryption. Browser shows green padlock followed by the company name.

Domain Validation Certificate: Low level of encription. You don't know who receives identity information. Fastest type of validation to get. Only secure the domain, not the subdomain.

Wildcard SSL Certificate: Allow you to use a certificate for domain and subdomains. Less expensive than purchasing multiple SSL's.

Unified Communications SSL Certificate: Displays padlock in address bar. Cover multiple domain names on the same certificate with one owner. Allow up to 100 domain names.

Single Domain SSL Certificate: Only protect one domain and not its subdomains.

## What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
Your URL starts with HTTPS instead of HTTP and you may have a padlock icon. These let users know your site is secure. THey keep the data between teh server and the browser secure.
