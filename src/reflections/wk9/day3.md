# Scrum for Small teams
## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
The sprints would not take on as many tasks and it would take longer to get products finished. With increased communication, there can be fewer meetings.
## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
You can run yourself thin and get into the unattainable triangle. If you don't have enough time to get something done, it's not going to be very good but, to get it to a good place, it'll take longer if there are multiple sprints.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
Good, Cheap, and Fast make up the three corners of the unattainable triangle. Cheap Good service isn't fast. Fast Good service isn't Cheap. Cheap Fast service isn't good. It's important to communicate to customers in Scrum so they know what they are getting/asking for.
