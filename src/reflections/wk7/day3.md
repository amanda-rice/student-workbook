# Designing a Strong User Experience

## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
It's the interactions your website has with users and the experience users have with your website. It's being able to communicate your views on the site but also how the user should be using the site in a clean way.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
One of the main benefits is people actually using your page. If they don't feel like they are getting anything from it or they don't understand how to use it, then there's no point having a site because they won't be coming back.

## Why is the User Experience important?
It doesn't matter how great your site is if no one uses it. It's important to focus on UX so users are comfortable using the site and they come back.
