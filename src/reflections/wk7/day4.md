# Partner Checkpoint Reflection

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
We used pair programming the entire time we worked together in class. It was nice not having to worry about merge conflicts or staying out of certain files.

## What went well?
I think the pair programming helped us catch errors early on. Also, there were little things that my partner did that I didn't know about and were cool tricks to add to my repertoire.

## What would you do differently?
When we weren't 100% sure on something, I think the pair programming actually hindered us because we didn't get to follow our individual thought processes out fully. In the future, I would suggest stopping when we got to difficult spots and individually researching it and coming back together to decide what to do. I think we sometimes confused each other when we were trying to sound out our solutions on the fly.
