# Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc
## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Documentation is leaving information about what your code is doing so you or another developer has a head start when it needs to be updated. Some examples are:

- How-to guides
- A detailed README
- inline source code documentation

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
It is very helpful for whoever edits the code next. Even if it's you, it saves a bunch of time if you don't have to decipher the existing code from scratch.

## How important is Code documentation and why?
It's pretty important. It can save a lot of time and headache in the future but, isn't 100% necessary. Definitely preferred.
