# Pair Programming
## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is two programmers working together on the same code. The driver is the person at the keyboard typing and the navigator helps give direction.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Better quality code. High potential for learning from partner. Helpful way to get someone unfamiliar with a component up to speed by pairing them with someone who is familiar. Less need for coordination since pairs are working on one thing together. 

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
It requires both programmers to be actively engaging. If it's not done well, it can 'double costs'. Requires two people to work very closely with each other. Pairs need to be made up of people who work well together.
