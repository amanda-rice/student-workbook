# Website Design

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
I like the idea of changing the text color instead of size. I know, my natural go-to would be a size change. My favorite tip for this is reducing the opacity of white text to de-emphasize. This way, if you change the background color, you don't have to worry about changing text color.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

[Elementor](https://elementor.com/blog/category/showcase/) 
 and 
[CSSNectar](https://cssnectar.com/css-gallery/winners/) both have good examples for design ideas. They may be a little above my design level but, they're good for inspiration.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Website design can help portray the aesthetic of a company. If a company wants to be known as modern, they may design a sharp, modern-looking site. On the other hand, another company may want a more whimsical site. Companies can also accidentally portray things through their sites as well. If someone doesn't put the time into regularly updating a website, it can start looking dated. For me, this is especially impactful when I go to ecommerce sites. If it looks old, I don't trust it.
