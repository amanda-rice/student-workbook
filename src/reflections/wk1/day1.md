# Intro to Codeworks

## In your own words, why do we use Git?
We use Git to manage our source code version history. If there is a bug, we can look back at older versions before the bug was introduced and fix it. Also, branches allow multiple developers to work on the same project at once. 
## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time. Users can commit their code up to their branch regularly so it is backed up. However, code doesn't get pushed to Master until it's clean. This keep code out of Master that isn't ready for production. Also, if something happens to one person's branch, only that branch is lost and no other branches are affected.
## What is the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that allows developers to manage and keep track of source code. Github is an additional tool that allows teams of developers to easily collborate and manage Git repositories. Since it's public, members of the team can see other editors' changes in real time.
