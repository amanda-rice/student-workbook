# Intro to Codeworks

## This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week, I've learned a lot about HTML and CSS. I'm not very familiar with front-end programming and have always felt overwhelmed trying to understand it. Everything is making a lot more sense now! The only thing I struggle with is remembering when I should be using justify, align, etc. with Bootstrap but, I know how to find that information in the documentation.
