##What is the purpose of wire-framing?

##What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity wire-frames serve as a starting point for designing a website. These are a useful tool that can be drawn up quickly in a meeting. They can help map user flow and website navigation. 

Mid-fidelity wire-frames are generated in an application and more accurately show the layout of the website. They are still very simple and don't include anything too distracting such as bright colors or images.

High-fidelity wire-frames display pixel-specific layouts. Unlike lower fidelity options, these include relevant text and images.


##Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes! They are useful throughout the design process. Being able to give stakeholders updated visual representations throughout the process allows for small changes along the way. This makes it less likely for a team to complete a project only the find out the stakeholders had a different vision for the design.
