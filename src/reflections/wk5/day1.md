# Using Query Parameters
## What is the purpose of a Query String?
Allows you to send information to/from a website by adding it to the end of the URL. This data can be used as a filter or to add additional data to a request.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
The query parameter starts with a question mark. If there are multiple parameters, they are divided by an ampersand. 

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
I think they would be helpful to filter or sort criteria. Also, they would be an easy way to go directly to  certain page.
