# RESTful Pattern
## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
Rest is REpresentational State Transfer. It's a design pattern where API's transfer a representation of the state to the client.

## What does Stateless mean?
The server does not retain information on the user using the API. Each request sent to the server will include all info needed each time.

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
RESTful URL's generally use the resource/identifier/resource pattern. Sometimes, they can also include the version.
An example would be: http://www.website.com/categories/houses/house.
