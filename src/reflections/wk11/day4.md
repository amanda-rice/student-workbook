# Course Reflection

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point. 
I don't have many concerns right now. I think I'm pretty good at managing time and I'll definitely start on the final project the weekend before it's due so I have a head start. 

I've really enjoyed the checkpoints. It's really cool to see everything I've learned in a week come together. It's also crazy to go back to the first few checkpoints and see how simple they were and how far I've come.
