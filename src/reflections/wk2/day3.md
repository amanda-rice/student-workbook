# Developer Tools
## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log() is used to log information to the console. This is often used for debugging and confirming the value of a variable at the time that console.log() was run.

console.error() is used to send a specific error message to the console.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The sources tab. Breakpoints can be added in the Code Editor which will then show up in the debugger. Once you hit a breakpoint, you can step into, over, and out of functions. Breakpoints can also be played through. Hovering over variables will tell you the value of that variable at the point the code is stopped.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

A better way to debug your code is to use the debugger in the web browser's Dev Tools. There, you can add breakpoints to see values of variables at specific points in time. This negates your need to print them to the console and can clean up your code.
