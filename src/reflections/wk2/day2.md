# JavaScript Functions
## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Function Declaration - Named function. Declared by using the word function and then the name you give it. When a function is declared, the function definition is hoisted so, it can be used before it is defined.

Function Expression - Can be named for anonymous. No hoisted so, they cannot be used before they are defined.

Arrow Function Expression - Shorter syntax for function expressions. Don't create their own 'this' value.

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

A parameter is defined and named as part of the function and receives the argument when the function is called. An argument is the value/expression given when calling the method. Method has parameters and takes arguments.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A function that returns a function or accepts another function as a parameter. For example, Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter.
