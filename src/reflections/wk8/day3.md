# Unit Testing
## What is Software Development Testing?
Testing the code. Generally, you test the smallest unit of code since, if the base isn't strong, everything else will fall apart. Unit testing can be testing a class or maybe a couple of classes.
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
Peace of mind knowing that the code has been well tested and has a lower chance of going wrong. Unit testing before sending code to QA means that there will be fewer issues and any errors sent back can be narrowed down to areas not yet tested.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
It can be hard to convince management to adopt unit testing and the extra time and money that goes along with it. Also, someone still has to come up with all the of the potential errors to test and things can still be missed.
