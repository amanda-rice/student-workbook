# An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio
## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It allows you to prove your skills. Shows experience when you don't have work experience. 

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Portfolios need to have the right projects in them. They need to be high quality to show your skill. You can decide to have a few high quality and high complexity projects or many smaller complexity projects.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I plan to include my capstone project because it's the biggest project I've created so far and it will be good to talk about both about the coding project and the interpersonal challenges of working on a dev team. I also want to include Buglog since it's a full-stack app but, it will need a little bit of cleanup and I'd like to add a little complexity.
