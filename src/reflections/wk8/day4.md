# Testing in Vue
## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- Unit Testing: Tests individual pieces of code independently of the rest of the application. Unit tests allow developers to feel confident that applications will still work after adding new code or refactoring.
- Component Testing: Tests components independently
- End-to-End Testing: Tests all layers of an application. 
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think unit testing is most helpful because it involves testing at the most basic level. This means the developer can make sure the units are working well initially before continuing to build on them.
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
It seems like End-to-End might be least helpful because it takes so long. When a process is inconvenient, I feel like it is less likely to be used.
