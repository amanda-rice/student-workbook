# Modules
## What problem does using exports solve?
It prevents you from having to list all of your scripts at the bottom of your HTML. Instead, they are concatenated in the main class.

## How does export differ from export default?
Export- allows you to export multiple. It is often used for big utility classes.

Export default- only one export allowed.

## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
Code is split into many smaller files which accomplish one task. This makes debugging easier and allows multiple people to edit the same application at the same time without stepping on toes.
