# Understanding Component Based Architecture
## What is Component based architecture?
A way to encapsulate components into separate micro-systems. A component is small piece of the user interface such as a chat window.

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
We design everything to do with a component within its class and they can refresh on their own. Also, components can be reused. For example, you can have multiple chat boxes but, they all work independently.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
It can result in bloated code. If there are a lot of components, it can make the code harder to read.
