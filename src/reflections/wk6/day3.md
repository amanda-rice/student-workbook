# Understanding VueJs Lifecycle Hooks
## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
They tell you when your component is created, updated, deleted or added to the DOM. For example, creation, mounting, destruction, and updating hooks.

## How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
We have use mounted to bring in data from API's to draw on page load. We also use setup so, you don't need to explicitly define beforeCreate and created.

## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
They allow access to a component right before and after the first render. They don't run on the server side rendering. You might use them to bring in data on or before loading your page.
