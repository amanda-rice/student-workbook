# Using Nested Routes in Vue.js
## What is a nested route?
Nested routes nest components inside each other. This allows for more complicated user interfaces.
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
When shopping for clothes online, there may be a women's clothing page. Nested within that could be the different categories. For example, tops, jeans, accessories.
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes, you can set up paths to accept a parameter like we've done before. For example: '/page1/:id'. I think ID would be the most common piece of data sent to another page.
