# C# Data Types and answer the following questions
## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value Types: Directly holds data in the variable. For example, int, char, enum, struct. Default value cannot be null since the data types holds a value.

Reference Types: Doesn't directly hold the data. Stores a pointer to where the value is stored. Ex: string, class, array. Default value is null.

Pointer Type: Holds the address of another type in memory. Cannot point to a reference type.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Directly holds data in the variable. For example, int, char, enum, struct. Default value cannot be null since the data types holds a value.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types get stored as a path to the value. With value types, the value is directly stored in the data type.
