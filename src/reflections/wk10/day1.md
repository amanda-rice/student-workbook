# Capstone Project Check-in
## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are using Vue.js, javascript, JSON, MongoDB, and Auth0. We are also using the Boardgame Atlas API.

## What went well so far?
We split the project up into two smaller apps and switched the teams every day. This meant that everyone got to touch every part of the application. We also had a floater board for whoever was floating that day since there were 5 team members. Any time we thought of something that needed to be done but wasn't necessarily something we needed two people working on, we'd add it to the floater board. Some examples were creating the background for our app, putting together the logo, and creating the Readme.

## What would you do differently? Why?
I would make sure we were thoroughly testing as we went while writing the backend. We stalled out a bit when one of the apps finally got tested adn there were a lot of issues that needed to be fixed. Also, we spent a lot of time in the mornings getting situated in our new pairs and we could have communicated better about what we had gotten done the day before in our stand ups.
