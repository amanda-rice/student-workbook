# C# List
s
## What is a List in C#?
It is similar to a javascript array. The type must be declared when instantiating a list.
## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.Add: it's similar to the .push() method.

List.BinarySearch(): gets the index of a value.

List.Contains(): returns a bool to tell you if a value exists in the list.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
If there was just one item I was looking for, I'd use List.Find(). If there were multiple, then I'd use List.FindAll().
