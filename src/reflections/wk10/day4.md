# C# Enum's

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are strongly typed and allow you to assign names to integral values. If you store North, South, East, and West as 0, 2, 3, and 4, an enum allows you to store that string name with the number so it's more readable.

## How can you modify an Enum?
They default to int but, you can change the base type of an enum to byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, int, ulong, or long. You can also change the value by using the equals sign and then the new value.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I haven't used Enums yet. If I had a project where I needed to use the days of the week stored as ints, I could create an enum with the int value stored with the name for increased readability.
